# Adventures in Homoiconicity

### An exploration by Franka Schmidt

## Good morning :clojureD! 👋

---

# Code is Data.

---

# Code is Data.

# Data is Code?

---

# Homo·icon·icity

---

# It's easy to write, manipulate, reason about Clojure programs -

# in Clojure.

## Homo·icon·icity is...

# a special property of Clojure programming language

class: normal

### Homo·icon·icity

<br>
## _Clojure is a *homoiconic* language, <br><br>which is a fancy term describing the fact that Clojure programs are represented by Clojure data structures._
<br><br><br>

.right[From [Clojure.org](https://clojure.org/reference/reader)]

layout: true
class: normal

### Same Representation

---

```clojure
user=> (+ 1 2)
3

```

=> A list of the forms `+`, `1` and `2`.

---
```clojure
user=> (def time-til-lunch (+ (* 1/2 30) 30 (rand-n 30))
49N
```

=> A list of the forms `def`, `time-til-lunch`, `'(+ (* 1/2 30) 30 (rand-n 30))`

---

class: normal

## It's ~~turtles~~ the same data structures all the way down!

---

class: normal

# EDN: Extensible Data Notation

### The set of data structures Clojure uses

```clojure
* Sequences '(1 2 3)

* Vectors [1 2 3]

* Numbers 1, 2
```

???

* kind of like JSON to Javascript

# Code is Data. Data is Code.

---
class: normal
## In Clojure we have \`quote\` and \`eval\`.

---
layout: true
class: normal

### quote and eval
# quote: Treat a form as Data

---

```clojure
user=> (+ 1 5)
6
```
---

```clojure
user=> (+ 1 5)
6

user=> (quote (+ 1 5))
(+ 1 5)

```
---

```clojure
user=> (+ 1 5)
6

user=> (quote (+ 1 5))
(+ 1 5)

user=> '(+ 1 5)
(+ 1 5)

```

---
layout: true
class: normal

### quote and eval
# eval: Treat a form as Code

---

```clojure
user=> (+ 1 5)
6
```
---

```clojure
user=> (+ 1 5)
6

user=> '(+ 1 5)
(+ 1 5)

```
---

```clojure
user=> (+ 1 5)
6

user=> '(+ 1 5)
(+ 1 5)

user=> (eval '(+ 1 5))
6

## Metaprogramming

# What about macros?

---

class: normal
## Macro:

### "a way to extend the compiler to use other syntactic constructs as primitives"

---

class: normal

### Macros

## Macros are omnipresent in everyday Clojure programming.

## (even when you don't know you're using them!)

---
layout: true
class: normal
### Macros

## `or`, `and`, `when`
---

```clojure
user=> (def n 42)
#'user/n
```
---

```clojure
user=> (def n 42)
#'user/n

user=> (when (even? n) "n is an even number!")
"n is an even number!"
```
---

```clojure
user=> (def n 42)
#'user/n

user=> (when (even? n) "n is an even number!")
"n is an even number!"

user=> (def n 43)
#'user/n
nil
```
---

```clojure
user=> (def n 42)
#'user/n

user=> (when (even? n) "n is an even number!")
"n is an even number!"

user=> (def n 43)
#'user/n

user=> (when (even? n) "n is an even number!")
nil
```

---
layout: true
class: normal
### Macros
## macroexpand: a neat trick!

---

```clojure
user=> (when (even? n) "n is an even number!")
"n is an even number!"
```
---

```clojure
user=> (when (even? n) "n is an even number!")
"n is an even number!"

user=> (macroexpand (when (even? n) "n is an even number!"))
"n is an even number!"
```
---

```clojure
user=> (when (even? n) "n is an even number!")
"n is an even number!"

user=> (macroexpand (when (even? n) "n is an even number!"))
"n is an even number!"

user=> (macroexpand '(when (even? n) "n is an even number!"))
(if (even? n) (do "n is an even number!"))
```

## What does homoiconicity give us?

* Extending our language with macros and DSLs
* Analyse code => powerful development tools
* Generate code => mutation testing, generative programming
* Visualise code => different analysis, new tools for devs?

## In conclusion...

---

class: normal, middle, center
# Yes.
## Homoiconicity is what allows for <br> writing macros in Clojure.

---

class: normal, middle, center
## But - perhaps more importantly - it also allows for many other great uses.

---

# One last thing:
## Support your local ClojureBridge!
