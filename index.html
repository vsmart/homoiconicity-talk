# Adventures with Homoiconicity

### An exploration by Franka @franschm

# homo\*icon\*icity

### homo\*icon\*icity

## homo: [Greek] - same

## icon: [Greek] - representation

---

### homo\*icon\*icity

## _In computer programming, homoiconicity is a property [...] in which the program structure is similar to its syntax, <br><br>and therefore the program's internal representation can be inferred by reading the text's layout._

## Homoiconicity in clojure

### it's ~~turtles~~ s-expressions all the way down

---

# So, what's an S-expression?

---

# Code is Data. Data is Code.

---

# What can we do with data?

### In Clojure we have `quote` and `eval`.

---

# `quote`: Treat Code as Data

---

# `eval`: Treat Data as Code

## What about macros?

## Macro:

### a way to extend the compilers to use other syntactic constructs as primitives

### Macro:
#### a way to extend the compilers to use other syntactic constructs as primitives

# e.g. `or`, `and`, `when`

---

## Clojure programmers & macros:

# A complicated relationship. 💔

---

### What can we do with data?

# Visualise it
# Analyse it
# Generate it

---

## Self-modifying code

### Case study:

# Mutants by @jstepien

<example>

# Persistent data structures by @hanshuebner

### Case study:

# Self-healing Code by @gigasquid
