# Adventures with Homoiconicity

### An exploration by Franka @franschm

# Homo·icon·icity

class: normal

## Homo·icon·icity

<br><br><br>
# [homo] · _Greek_ · 'same'

# [icon] · _Greek_ · 'representation'


???

* let's look at the roots of the word to give us some indicator
* doing this is also a great way to actually remember how to pronounce this word
and not get stuck with <homoiconic...ity>?

### Homo·icon·icity

## _Homoiconicity is a property [...] in which the program structure is similar to its syntax, <br><br>and therefore the program's internal representation can be inferred by reading the text's layout._
<br><br><br>

class: normal

### Homo·icon·icity

<br>
## _Clojure is a *homoiconic* language, <br><br>which is a fancy term describing the fact that Clojure programs are represented by Clojure data structures._
<br><br><br>

.right[From [Clojure.org](https://clojure.org/reference/reader)]

## In Clojure, Homoiconicity means that the languages underlying representation is the same as the language's data structures.

???

* In my words, ....
* Might need a rephrase

# So, what's an S-expression?

## EDN: Extensible Data Notation

class: center, middle, main
# Code is Data. Data is Code.

class: normal
## In Clojure we have \`quote\` and \`eval\`.

---

class: normal

### quote and eval
# quote: Treat a form as Data

```clojure
user=> (+ 1 5)
6

user=> (quote (+ 1 5))
(+ 1 5)

user=> '(+ 1 5)
(+ 1 5)

```

---

class: normal

### quote and eval
# eval: Treat a form as Code

```clojure
user=> (+ 1 5)
6

user=> '(+ 1 5)
(+ 1 5)

user=>(eval '(+ 1 5))
6

```
???

* our repl does this automatically

## Summary

---

class: normal, middle, center
### Yes, Homoiconicity is what makes it possible to write macros.

---

class: normal, middle, center
## But (perhaps more importantly) it also allows for many other great uses.
