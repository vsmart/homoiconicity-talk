### homo\*icon\*icity

## _In computer programming, homoiconicity is a property [...] in which the program structure is similar to its syntax, <br><br>and therefore the program's internal representation can be inferred by reading the text's layout._

## Homoiconicity in Clojure

---
class: center, middle, normal

### it's ~~turtles~~ s-expressions all the way down

---

class: center, middle, normal
# So, what's an S-expression?

---
class: center, middle, main
# Code is Data. Data is Code.

---

class: middle, normal
### In Clojure we have `quote` and `eval`.

---

class: normal
# `quote`: Treat Code as Data

---

class: normal
# `eval`: Treat Data as Code

---
class: normal, center, middle
# It's about perspective.

class: middle, main
## What about macros?

---

class: normal
## Macro:

### a way to extend the compilers to use other syntactic constructs as primitives

### Macro:
#### a way to extend the compilers to use other syntactic constructs as primitives

# e.g. `or`, `and`, `when`

## Clojure programmers & macros:

# A complicated relationship. üíî

class: main
# Clojure as a _Data-first_ language

---

class: normal
# Clojure Programmers are used to handling data.

---

class: normal
# What can we do with data?

class: normal
### What can we do with data?

# Visualise it
# Analyse it
# Generate it

---

class: normal
## So, let's go on an adventure! üêâ
# And see what happens if we do these things with our code.

## Summary

---

class: normal, middle, center
### Yes, Homoiconicity is what makes it possible to write macros.

---

class: normal, middle, center
## But (perhaps more importantly) it also allows for many other great uses.
