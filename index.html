# Adventures with Homoiconicity

### An exploration by Franka @franschm

# Homo·icon·icity

class: normal

## Homo·icon·icity

<br><br><br>
# [homo] · _Greek_ · 'same'

# [icon] · _Greek_ · 'representation'


???

* let's look at the roots of the word to give us some indicator
* doing this is also a great way to actually remember how to pronounce this word
and not get stuck with <homoiconic...ity>?

---

class: normal

### Homo·icon·icity

## _Homoiconicity is a property [...] in which the program structure is similar to its syntax, <br><br>and therefore the program's internal representation can be inferred by reading the text's layout._
<br><br><br>

.right[From [Wikipedia: Homoiconicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity)]

---

class: normal

### Homo·icon·icity

<br>
## _Clojure is a *homoiconic* language, <br><br>which is a fancy term describing the fact that Clojure programs are represented by Clojure data structures._
<br><br><br>

.right[From [Clojure.org](https://clojure.org/reference/reader)]


---

class: normal

## In Clojure, Homoiconicity means that the languages underlying representation is the same as the language's data structures.

???

* In my words, ....
* Might need a rephrase

### Same Representation

<br><br>

---

```clojure
user=> (+ 1 2)
3

```

=> A list of the forms `+`, `1` and `2`.

---
```clojure
user=> (def time-til-lunch (+ (* 1/2 30) 30 (rand-n 30))
49N
```

=> A list of the forms `def`, `time-til-lunch`, `'(+ (* 1/2 30) 30 (rand-n 30))`

### It's ~~turtles~~ s-expressions all the way down!

---

class: center, middle, normal
# So, what's an S-expression?

---
class: normal
## EDN: Extensible Data Notation

### The set of data structures Clojure uses (kind of like JSON to Javascript)

```clojure
* Sequences '(1 2 3)
* Vectors [1 2 3]
* Numbers 1, 2
```

---
class: center, middle, main
# Code is Data. Data is Code.

---

class: normal
## In Clojure we have \`quote\` and \`eval\`.

---
layout: true
class: normal

### quote and eval
# quote: Treat a form as Data

---

```clojure
user=> (+ 1 5)
6
```
---

```clojure
user=> (+ 1 5)
6

user=> (quote (+ 1 5))
(+ 1 5)

```
---

```clojure
user=> (+ 1 5)
6

user=> (quote (+ 1 5))
(+ 1 5)

user=> '(+ 1 5)
(+ 1 5)

```

---
layout: false
class: normal

### quote and eval
# eval: Treat a form as Code

```clojure
user=> (+ 1 5)
6

user=> '(+ 1 5)
(+ 1 5)

user=> (eval '(+ 1 5))
6

```

## Metaprogramming

# What about macros?

---

class: normal
## Macro:

### "a way to extend the compiler to use other syntactic constructs as primitives"

---

class: normal

### Macros

## Macros are omnipresent in everyday Clojure programming.

## (even when you don't know you're using them!)

---

class: normal
### Macros

## `or`, `and`, `when`

```clojure
user=> (def n 42)
#'user/n

user=> (when (even? n) "n is an even number!")
"n is an even number!"

user=> (def n 43)
#'user/n

user=> (when (even? n) "n is an even number!")
nil
```
---

layout: true
class: normal
### Macros
## macroexpand: a neat trick!

---

```clojure
user=> (when (even? n) "n is an even number!")
"n is an even number!"
```
---

```clojure
user=> (when (even? n) "n is an even number!")
"n is an even number!"

user=> (macroexpand (when (even? n) "n is an even number!"))
"n is an even number!"
```
---

```clojure
user=> (when (even? n) "n is an even number!")
"n is an even number!"

user=> (macroexpand (when (even? n) "n is an even number!"))
"n is an even number!"

user=> (macroexpand '(when (even? n) "n is an even number!"))
(if (even? n) (do "n is an even number!"))
```

## In conclusion...

---

class: normal, middle, center
# Yes.
## Homoiconicity is what allows for <br> writing macros in Clojure.

---

class: normal, middle, center
## But - perhaps more importantly - it also allows for many other great uses.
