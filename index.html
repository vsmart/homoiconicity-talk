## homo: [Greek] - same

### homo\*icon\*icity

## _In computer programming, homoiconicity is a property [...] in which the program structure is similar to its syntax, <br><br>and therefore the program's internal representation can be inferred by reading the text's layout._

# What can we do with data?

### What can we do with data?

# Visualise it
# Analyse it
# Generate it

### In Clojure we have `quote` and `eval`

---

## `quote` : Treat Code as Data

## `eval` : Treat Data as Code

---

## maybe homoiconicity isn't the point:

# ..., but a language's 'willingness'

## What about macros?

## Macro:

### a way to extend the compilers to use other syntactic constructs as primitives
