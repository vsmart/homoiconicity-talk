# [homo] ¬∑ _Greek_ ¬∑ 'same'

# [icon] ¬∑ _Greek_ ¬∑ 'representation'

* let's look at the roots of the word to give us some indicator
* doing this is also a great way to actually remember how to pronounce this word
and not get stuck with <homoiconic...ity>?

### Homo¬∑icon¬∑icity

<br>
## _Clojure is a *homoiconic* language, <br><br>which is a fancy term describing the fact that Clojure programs are represented by Clojure data structures._
<br><br><br>

.right[From [Clojure.org](https://clojure.org/reference/reader)]

---

class: normal

### Homo¬∑icon¬∑icity

<br>
## _In Clojure, Homoiconicity means that the languages underlying representation is the same as the language's data structures._

<br><br><br>
.right[From Franka]

### Same Representation

---

```clojure
user=> (+ 1 2)
3

```

=> A list of the forms `+`, `1` and `2`.

---
```clojure
user=> (def time-til-lunch (+ (* 1/2 30) 30 (rand-n 30))
49N
```

=> A list of the forms `def`, `time-til-lunch`, `'(+ (* 1/2 30) 30 (rand-n 30))`

---

class: normal

## It's ~~turtles~~ the same data structures all the way down!

---

class: normal

# EDN: Extensible Data Notation

### The set of data structures Clojure uses (kind of like JSON to Javascript).

```clojure
* Sequences '(1 2 3)

* Vectors [1 2 3]

* Numbers 1, 2
```

# Code is Data. Data is Code.

class: normal
## In Clojure we have \`quote\` and \`eval\`.

---
layout: true
class: normal

### quote and eval
# quote: Treat a form as Data

---

```clojure
user=> (+ 1 5)
6
```
---

```clojure
user=> (+ 1 5)
6

user=> (quote (+ 1 5))
(+ 1 5)

```
---

```clojure
user=> (+ 1 5)
6

user=> (quote (+ 1 5))
(+ 1 5)

user=> '(+ 1 5)
(+ 1 5)

```

---
layout: true

### quote and eval
# eval: Treat a form as Code

---

```clojure
user=> (+ 1 5)
6
```
---

```clojure
user=> (+ 1 5)
6

user=> '(+ 1 5)
(+ 1 5)

```

## Metaprogramming

# What about macros?

---

class: normal
## Macro:

### "a way to extend the compiler to use other syntactic constructs as primitives"

---

class: normal

### Macros

## Macros are omnipresent in everyday Clojure programming.

## (even when you don't know you're using them!)

---

class: normal
### Macros

## `or`, `and`, `when`

```clojure
user=> (def n 42)
#'user/n

user=> (when (even? n) "n is an even number!")
"n is an even number!"

user=> (def n 43)
#'user/n

user=> (when (even? n) "n is an even number!")
nil
```
---

layout: true
class: normal
### Macros
## macroexpand: a neat trick!

---

```clojure
user=> (when (even? n) "n is an even number!")
"n is an even number!"
```
---

```clojure
user=> (when (even? n) "n is an even number!")
"n is an even number!"

user=> (macroexpand (when (even? n) "n is an even number!"))
"n is an even number!"
```
---

```clojure
user=> (when (even? n) "n is an even number!")
"n is an even number!"

user=> (macroexpand (when (even? n) "n is an even number!"))
"n is an even number!"

user=> (macroexpand '(when (even? n) "n is an even number!"))
(if (even? n) (do "n is an even number!"))

## In conclusion...

---

class: normal, middle, center
# Yes.
## Homoiconicity is what allows for <br> writing macros in Clojure.

---

class: normal, middle, center
## But - perhaps more importantly - it also allows for many other great uses.
