# Outline

# Homoiconicity (aka WHATS HOMOICONICITY)

* definition
* in comp sci...
* in clojure...

## how does it work?

* lispy s-expressions
* everything is everything (turtles all the way downj)

## quote and eval

* treat code as data, treat data as code
* aka perspective

# what does it let us do? (aka THE ADVENTURES)

===> actually the main part


## code is *data* (gen, vis, analyse)

* clojure is data-first
* data-description comes

## but what about macros?

### generate

* self-healing code
* mutation testing
* manipulate the AST
* something something clojure.spec

### visualise

* needs examples
* a quil sketch that shows you how many lines it's written in?

### analyse

* needs examples

## what do these tell us?
* homoiconicity is a super _powerful_ concept of clojure


## summary (where did we go)

oh my, so much to say!
